# ETL Pipeline Project

This project demonstrates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline built in Python. The pipeline extracts data from an external API, transforms it using `pandas`, validates the data, and loads it into a PostgreSQL database. The code highlights essential skills for data engineering, including data manipulation, database integration, and logging for monitoring.

## Features
- **Data Extraction**: Pulls data from a public API (`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users`).
- **Data Transformation**: Cleans and normalizes JSON data into a structured format using `pandas`.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality by checking for missing values or inconsistencies.
- **Database Integration**: Stores the cleaned data in a PostgreSQL database using `SQLAlchemy`.
- **Logging**: Tracks the ETL process with detailed logs for debugging and monitoring.
